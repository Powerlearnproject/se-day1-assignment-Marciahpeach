Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, and testing of software applications. 
Its reliable,efficient,high demand,problem solving.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity- object oriented-ensures correctness.
Mastering communications-industrial -client/server complex projects
Mastering communication -Distributed-Intergrated model quality


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- One plans on what project to start
Designing-you design a wireframe of the project to start
Development-Implementing on the design and coding it
Testing-test whether the project you have created is working
Deployment-submitting and storing of your code online for people to comment and use.
Maintenance-making sure your code is well taken care of.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is when tasks in a project are approached in a linear, sequantial manner like construction of a building while agile methodology emphasizes on collaboration, flexibility and continous improvement like the use of spotify one can collaborate with friends.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-designing, building, and maintaining software applications
Quality Assurance Engineer-analyses, create tests documentation, execute test cases and ensures that the software passes all checks before its released to the public.
Project Manager-plans, organizes, and directs the completion of specific projects for an organization while ensuring the projects are on time, on budget, and within scope


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE- these are essential tools in software development that offer efficiency in code management, debugging, and customization like pycharm,xcode.
VCS- helps to  manage the source code for a software team by keeping track of all the code modifications like git,perforce.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debbugging-breaking down complex problems into smaller manageable tasks
Communication barriers-effective communication and collaboration with stakeholders
Limited infrastructure-utilizing relevant tools and frameworks
Technology changes- continuous learning to keep up with evolving technologies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit-behaviour of an application, ensure that individual parts of an application work.
Intergration-combines and tests individual units of an application as a group,softare and hardware tests if there's any relation. 
System- enables timely detection and mitigation of possible threats, mistakes, and failures.
Acceptance-ensures that the delivered product meets specific requirements and performs the way the client ordered.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promp engineering is the process where you guide generative AI  to generate desired outputs.
It helps to ensure that AI models produced are accurate and relevant and personalization.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 My dream car is a Gwagon mercedes make.The G-Wagon has been hand built in Austria since 1979.The leather inside these cars is hand-tooled, and even some of the V-8 engines in AMG models are assembled by hand.It's this kind of love and attention to detail that Mercedes put into the G-Wagon that makes it loved by purists and enthusiasts around the world.
It is short and brief of a Gwagon-mercedes make.
